Ketp here for historical reasons, all this information should be in README.md

Unnecessary fork of Fabien Gigante's Lode Runner (see http://code.google.com/p/loderunner/)

I'm more than willing to delete this project and collaborate with the original, but I wasn't able to contact the author.

For users, the main differences are:

  * Compatible with more cellphones, not nokia exclusive anymore (ideally with all of them)
  * Better menu when pressing 0

  * User can select level: Just enter the number in pause screen. Use 003 for level 3, that is to say, complete with 0's
  * You can exit the program with # in the pause screen
  * Program will remember already finished levels and show a "Done!" tag if you select it.

  * But if you start it again, it will clear that tag.
  * You can clear all "Done!" tags using the asterisk (`*`) key
  * Next level button will take you to the next **unsolved** level
  * Better handling of small/big screens
  * Some minor drawing issues fixed

For developers, the main differences are
  * No nokia classes
  * A package!
  * Some minor warnings resolved
  * The extra functionality and issues fixed, of course
  * It is a Netbeans project now

Have fun! It is a great game
